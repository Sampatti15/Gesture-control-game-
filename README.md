# ✋ Gesture Controlled Game (Python + OpenCV + Mediapipe)

A simple gesture-controlled system where you can use your fingers to control game actions instead of a keyboard! 
This project uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI to detect hand gestures in real-time and map them to keyboard inputs.

## ▶️ How to Run
-Clone this repository or download the code.
-Install dependencies
-Open a terminal in the project folder.
# Run the program:
-python game.py
