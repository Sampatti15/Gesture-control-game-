✋ Gesture Controlled Game (Python + OpenCV + Mediapipe)

A simple gesture-controlled system where you can use your fingers to control game actions instead of a keyboard! 
This project uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI to detect hand gestures in real-time and map them to keyboard inputs.

▶️ How to Run

Clone this repository or download the code.

Open a terminal in the project folder.

Run the program:
python game.py

Allow webcam access.

Play the game using hand gestures! 🎉
